# Academic Enrollment System

## Overview

The Academic Enrollment System is a self-developed project designed to manage course registrations, validate prerequisites, and handle user authentication. This project was developed between May 2023 and June 2023 using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Features

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication with role-based access controls to enhance security and manage user sessions effectively.
- **Dynamic Course Registration**: Developed a dynamic course registration system with built-in prerequisite validation to ensure that students meet the necessary requirements before enrolling in courses.
- **Comprehensive HTTP Responses**: Enhanced user feedback by implementing detailed HTTP responses that provide informative messages about course registration outcomes, including success, errors, and prerequisite validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to create the server and manage routes.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing user and course data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication and role-based access control.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following key files:

- **`server.js`**: Main server file that sets up the Express.js server and handles routing.
- **`DDL.sql`**: SQL file for database schema definitions.
- **`postgres.md`**: Documentation for PostgreSQL setup and configurations.
- **`login.html`**: HTML file for user login interface.
- **`sql_injection.txt`**: Information related to SQL injection and security measures.
